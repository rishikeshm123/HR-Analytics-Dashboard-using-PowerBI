An HR dashboard is a business intelligence tool that allows Human Resource teams to track, analyze and report on HR KPIs. Modern, interactive dashboards leverage an HR analytics platform which makes it easy to combine data from all systems and to deeply explore this data directly within the dashboard. This way, HR teams can quickly find insights that will improve recruiting, optimize workplace management and enhance employee performance.
